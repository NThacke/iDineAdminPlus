     The section that this item belongs to. Every menu (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) is further categorized into sections. There is no pre-defined sections -- the administrator must create their own sections.
     
        This program ensures that every item belonging to a particular menu and section will be sorted in the same category. For example, let us assume that there exists three menu items on the entire menu :
     
            Menu Type
                Section Type A
                        item x
                        item y
                Section Type B
                        item w
                        item z
     
            Breakfast
                Classics
                        Toast & Eggs
                        Bacon & Eggs
                Omeletes
                        Western Omelete
            
     This shows three items in the Breakfast menu type. Beneath it, there are two sections. One section is named "Classics" and includes "Toast & Eggs" and "Bacon & Eggs". Another section is named "Omeletes", and includes a "Western Omelete" as an item.
     
     If a user added another menu item that was some other category, the program will create that section on the fly. If they add a new menu item for a section that already exists, it'll include it in that section.
